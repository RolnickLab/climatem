What is the shape of the mean of the predictions? torch.Size([256, 1, 400])
What is the shape of the variance of the predictions? torch.Size([256, 1, 400])
What is the shape when I try to take the mean across the batch and coordinates: tensor([-0.0020])
Spatial spectra score, lower is better...should be a spectra for each var tensor([6.2540])
tensor(False)
new score tensor([6.2540])
previous best score tensor([6.1523])
Not plotting predictions.
